There are always those who ask, what is it all about? For those who
need to ask, for those who need points sharply made, who need to know
"where it's at," this: "The mass of men serve the state thus, not as
men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing
army, and the militia, jailors, constables, posse comitatus, etc. In
most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the
moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and
stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the
purposes as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw or a
lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs.
Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others as
most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders
serve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any
moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the Devil, without
intending it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs,
reformers in the great sense, and men, serve the state with their
consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and
they are commonly treated as enemies by it."

Henry David Thoreau, "Civil Disobedience"
